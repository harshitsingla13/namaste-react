# Bundlers - Webpack, Parcel

# npm i -D where -D denotes dev dependencies as they are needed during development phase.

# use of ^ in package.json dependency is that it upgrades to the latest minor version release

# use of ~ in package.json dependency is that it upgrades to the latest major version release

# Transitive Depenencies:- When a dependencies has its own dependencies and this goes on until some end.

# npx command is used to execute the package whereas npm is used to install the package

# adding React using cdn is not a good way as it takes time to load and as well as to upgrade dependency we need to change it in html.

# Webpack is better than Parcel

# JSX is not HTML but it is like HTML/XML syntax. It outputs the same as React.createElement
# JSX code is transpiled/converted by Babel before going to the JS engine
# JSX prevents Cross Site Scripting attack
# Component composition means using another React component in a React component
